My name's Justin, and I'm currently an undergraduate at the University of British Columbia. I previously graduated with a degree in Behavioural Neuroscience, and am now studying Computer Science as a second degree (part of the UBC BCS program!).

Most of my previous technical experience has been in the realm of data analysis (primarily using R) for life-science or health-related research projects, though Iâ€™ve slowly been exploring more general coding projects as I learn more about CS in general. 

Iâ€™m passionate about data science and programming â€“ itâ€™s what initially attracted me to study Computer Science in the first place â€“ and am interested in exploring careers in data analytics, software development, and data engineering!
