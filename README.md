I'm Justin, and I'm a current undergraduate student at the University of British Columbia. I previously graduated with a degree in Behavioural Neuroscience, and am now studying Computer Science as a second degree (part of the UBC BCS program!).

I began my foray into the world of programming through the realm of data analysis, primarily using R for life-science or health-related research projects, though Iâ€™ve slowly been exploring more general coding projects as I learn more about Computer Science. I'm currently interning as a software developer, and hope to learn as much as I can about building high quality software and systems. 

Iâ€™m passionate about data science and programming â€“ itâ€™s what initially attracted me to study Computer Science in the first place â€“ and am interested in exploring careers in data analytics and engineering, and software development.
