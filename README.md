I'm currently building software to improve the architecture and engineering industry at [StructureCraft](https://structurecraft.com/) ([Branch3D](https://www.branch3d.com/)).


Before that, I graduated with a second degree in computer science (BCS) at the University of British Columbia.

In a previous life, I used to be in life sciences. Then I did a couple of stints in cancer and neuroscience research. 

Then I switched to CS, and I've been having a blast ever since.
